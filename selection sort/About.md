# What is Selection sort?

Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by finding the smallest element in an array that has not been sorted, then swapping it out for the first element. This process is repeated for the remaining sub-arrays until the entire array is sorted.

## How it works

1. Find the smallest element. Find the smallest element in the unsorted array.
2. Swap elements. Swap the smallest element with the first element in an unsorted sub-array.
3. Repeat. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the remaining sub-arrays, starting from the second element to the end.

## Advantage

Simple to implement.

## Deficiency

It is inefficient for large data, because it has a time complexity O(n^2).
