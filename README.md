# Python arrays Data Structure Algorithm

This project contains the implementation of a wide variety of data structures and algorithms in the Python language. The purpose of this project is to Provides an example of the syntax of the data array structure in the Python programming language.

Data structures are a way to organize and store data in a computer so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently. There are various types of data structures with different characteristics and uses.

## Linear Data Structure
Linear data structures have elements arranged in order. Some examples of linear data structures:

1. Array: A collection of elements of the same data type, accessed through an index.
2. Linked List: A collection of elements that are not stored sequentially in memory, but are linked via a pointer.
3. Stack: LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure, the last element to be inserted is the first to be issued.
4. Queue: FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure, the first element to be entered is the first to be issued.

## Non-Linear Data Structure
Non-linear data structures have no linear sequence between their elements. Some examples of non-linear data structures:

1. Tree: A hierarchical data structure, with the main elements called the root, and the branches called the children.
2. Graph: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges (sides).
3. Hash Table: A data structure that uses hash functions to quickly store and search for elements.
